Add properties files mapping...
  state <--> order of entry to the Union
  counyry -> continent
  continent specific versions of:
    coutry <--> capital
  car model -> car make

Add new types of tests
  true/false
  multiple choice

Add ability to declare extra details about properties files
  Something like <filename>.props  <-- <filename>.props.config
  The config file might contain...
    A description of the concepts/mapping to be tested
    Type of exam
      This would probably be better encoded in the filename, something
        exam.map.props vs exam.truefalse.props vs exam.multiChoice.props

Add GUI

Add user accounts

Add tracking of results
  Over repeating testing within a session
  Over time/multiple sessions
